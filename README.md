# VACon
Find how many of your Steam Friends are VAC Banned.

This project aims to show how many Players in your friends list have been VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) Banned.

This first commit is a simple python file that takes a 64-bit Steam ID as its single command line parameter, and prints through standard output a list of Friends of this Steam ID, and their VAC status.
